About Me

Hello Everyone!

My Name is LZZZ Im From Australia, 
Currently in High School Studying - Software Design & Developement, Maths & Engineering Studies.

Interests:
- I love The Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF).
- Since 2017 I have Been in the Australian Airforce Cadets, This has tought me many many valuable skills, the best skill ive learnt is Leadership and Confidence. To be able to stand up in front of a group, classroom, Bush Exercises, Outdoors and take the role of a Leader.

My Hobbies:
- I Love to Learn & about Ethical Hacking & Cyber Security.
- I Started a website as I wanted to teach people about dangers and how to stay safe on the Internet. As of creating the site I thought no one would actually pay any attention to it so the domain of the website is: https://urmumstanky.weebly.com
Im actually very happy with my website now, I started my website about 5-6 Months ago, to be exact Tuesday 23rd March. It Contains about 30 pages full of information & Tips & Tricks.

Experiences Online:
- I have Built many Websites including Ecommerce, Online Stores, Gaming, Blogs, Information, School Recourses. But My favourite Website is the current one im still updating (https://urmumstanky.weebly.com).
- I Have Some Experience Using Amazon Web Service (AWS) Where I Created a Virtual Matchine with EC2, OpenVPN Service & Started some more Projects to Learn More.
- I Have Used Linode (Cloud Service) many times in the past to current. Ive Created and Used some of the following: Docker, Guacamole, Kubernetes, phpMyAdmin & Hosting A Minecraft Server For My Mates & I.
- Ive Used Google Cloud Console for many different things, weather its just to use the Console for Challenges such as OSINT or CTFs.

* I Love CTF's (Capture The Flags) To be honest I'm not good at them as you need alot of experience to complete tasks, I still love them and try my hardest to get the Flag, sometimes I do & when I cant Ill do research to Learn from My Mistakes.

My Dream Job Was to be Pilot in the RAAF to fly A C-130J Hercules, But At the DFR (Defence Force Recruitment)
 I was told I'm too Tall. So Since that I've referred back to my Interests of technology. 
 Maybe One Day i can work in a Cyber Role in the Defence or For a Company.
